Two directories:

1. To get the project start, first jump into the `/api-test` directory and run `npm install` or `npm i` followed by `npm run dev`. 
2. After that jump into the `/front-test` directory and run the same commands, i.e.  `npm install` or `npm i` followed by `npm run dev`.

You should see the API on http://localhost:3000/ and FrontApp on http://localhost:5173/
